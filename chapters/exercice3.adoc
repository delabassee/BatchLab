== Lab: Checkpoints and the JobOperator interface

This exercise is focusing on two additional JSR 352 aspects: checkpoint and the JobOperator interface.

*JobOperator* provides an interface to manage all aspects of job processing, including operational commands, such as start, restart, and stop, as well as job repository commands. We have already used it in previous exercises to start jobs and also to get their execution status. In this exercise, we will see how we can resume the execution of a failed job.

To avoid having to restart a failed job from the beginning, JSR 352 support the concept of checkpoint. A *checkpoint* allows a step to periodically bookmark its current progress to enable restart from the last point of consistency should this job be stopped (intentionally or unintentionally).


=== Set the stage

Open and run the "Lab 3" project. This PayRoll application is again very similar. It has a single Chunk step. The only real difference is that this application let you update, delete and add Input Records. We will use this feature to intentionally introduce corrupt data to force our job to fail. We will finally use the JobOperator interface to resume the job execution where it has failed.


The GlassFish console is a useful tool to understand what is going on. Go in the "Services" tab and locate the GlassFish instance (it's probably called "GlassFish 4.1" or "GlassFish Server"). Right click on it and select "View Domain Server Log", this action will open the GlassFish Logs in the NetBeans "Output" window.

=== Start a job

Locate the `displayPayrollForm()` method in the `BatchJobSubmitter` servlet. This method uses a `switch` to handle the different commands: start a job to calculate a payroll, add, update and delete input records.

If you look at the `submitJobFromXML()` method that is invoked via the "calculatePayroll" command, you will notice that starting a job is easy.
[source, java]
----
  JobOperator jobOperator = BatchRuntime.getJobOperator(); // get a jobOperator instance
  Properties props = new Properties(); // set some properties
  id = jobOperator.start(jobName, props); // and start to job
----

 
A `jobOperator` instance is used to interact with the batch runtime. Once you have that instance, all you have to do is to invoke its `start()` method and pass it the jobNanme and eventually some properties (see  http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/batch/operations/JobOperator.html#start[javadoc]). Note that the jobName parameter is the actual name of the JSL file describing the job (without the XML extension). The 'start()' method will return an execution ID that we can use to continue to interact with the job via the batch runtime (e.g. stop the job, query the status of the job, etc.).

--
TIP: The location of the job xml is spec defined. It must be defined under "WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/batch-jobs" (for war files) or under "META-INF/batch-jobs" (for ejb jar files).
--


=== Break the job!

We will now introduce some corrupt data to force our job to fail. For example, you can update the 5th record by replacing the "," with a space and click "update". You can now start the job and "if everything goes well", your job will fail with an "Exit status: FAILED". A "restart" button should also appear on the right side of the last failed job.

In the log, we can see that the Job fails at the fifth record and that there is a checkpoint every *2* records. This is defined in the Chunk step element in the JSL file.
The "item-count" attribue (the size) of the "chunk" element specify the number of items to process per chunk (10 per default). At the end, a checkpoint will be performed since this is an obvious place for such action.

TIP: Any real application would obviously implement more severe validation strategies. We haven't because it's not the purpose of this exercise and we are also using that weaknesses to demonstrate some of the JSR5352 features.

=== Resume a failed job

We will now update the  `displayPayrollForm()` method to also handle the "restart" command. In `switch' construction, add an extra `case` with the following logic to handle the "restart" command with the following logic.

[source, java]
----
   case "restart":
      executionId = restartJob(executionId);
      session.setAttribute("executionId", executionId);
      break;
----
Restarting a failed job is also done via the jobOperator interface and more particularly via its `restart()` method. We pass, to this method, the execution ID of the failed job and we get in return a new execution ID.

--
TIP: JSR 352 allows only the most recent execution id to the restart method. Thats why our application attaches the restart button to the most recent job! 
--

If you fix and update the wrong input record and "restart" the job, the job should now exit with a "COMPLETED" status.

If you check the GlassFish log, you will notice that job is restarted from the last known checkpint (i.e. 4) so it read and process the next item (5 in this case). A final checkpoint is performed after the last record.

=== Summary

Job restarts (resumption of jobs rather) is possible due to the checkpointing mechanism. Execution of a check style step commences by the batch runtime calling the ItemReader's `open()` method. If the step is not due to a re-start (meaning a the job is being executed using `jobOperator.start()`) then a `null` value is passed to the `open()` method (else the previous checkpointed data is passed).
Once every "item-count" (chunk size) number of items have been written out by the ItemWriter, the Batch runtime calls the `checkpointInfo()` method on the ItemReader. The item reader can return any Serializable data that captures its current state (like number of items read etc.). This Serializable data will be saved by the batch runtime in the JobRepository and allows the batch runtime to track the last known checkpointed state.
If the job were to fail now (or before the next checkpoint), the Job can be resumed by calling the `JobOperator.restart()` method. Job restart processing begins by the batch runtime calling the ItemReader's `open()` method with the previous run's checkpointed data. This allows the ItemReader to resume reading from the previous successful point and thus allows the Job to resume rather than start from the beginning.
